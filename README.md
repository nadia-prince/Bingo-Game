# Bingo-Game

Bingo Game â€” A web-based interactive bingo game where users play against an automated number-drawer ("the old man"). The game dynamically generates a 7x7 bingo board with unique random numbers for each session. Players try to mark numbers as they're drawn, and winning is announced when a full row or column is completed. The game features strike tracking and user-friendly design with responsive visuals, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
